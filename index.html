        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I have always loved problem solving, which is something that I did a lot of while working in hospitality. After graduating with a degree in Economics from The University of Massachusetts, I decided to take some time to travel the world. I was lucky enough to work in many different kinds of hospitality and tourism along the way. This industry has let me live a flexible life, while also teaching me valuable lessons in problem solving and troubleshooting. Anything can happen during a busy shift at a restaurant, and I believe that has fine tuned my ability to solve any issue that may arise.</p>
